DURATION: 4 WEEKS


🔐 Big Data Security and Compliance Framework

📌 Project Title:
Design a Framework to Ensure Security and Compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) for a Big Data System

🧾 Project Description:
This project focuses on one of the most critical aspects of working with Big Data: security and compliance. As data continues to grow in volume, velocity, and variety, ensuring its protection and adhering to regulatory standards like GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) becomes vital.

As part of the Big Data Internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS, this project aims to design a simple, beginner-friendly framework that outlines how sensitive and personal data should be securely handled in a Big Data system. This includes steps to protect, monitor, and audit data, as well as practices to maintain compliance with international data protection laws.

The framework is conceptual but based on real-world principles used in industries like healthcare, finance, and government where data privacy is non-negotiable.

🎯 Objective:
✅ Understand the risks and responsibilities of handling large-scale personal/sensitive data

✅ Create a high-level security architecture

✅ Apply core security practices like encryption, access control, and anonymization

✅ Align practices with basic requirements of GDPR and HIPAA

✅ Present findings in a structured report format

🔧 Technologies / Concepts Used:
Big Data Platforms (Spark/Hadoop – conceptual only)

Security Principles: Encryption, RBAC, Audit Logging

Compliance Regulations: GDPR, HIPAA (basic understanding)

Documentation Tools: Microsoft Word, PDF

🛠️ Framework Components:
1. Data Ingestion Security
All incoming data is encrypted during transfer using TLS (Transport Layer Security) to prevent interception.

2. Storage Protection
Data is encrypted at rest using industry standards like AES-256, ensuring even stored files remain protected.

3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Access is given based on user roles (e.g., analyst, admin), ensuring only authorized personnel can view or manipulate sensitive data.

4. Anonymization & Pseudonymization
Personal Identifiable Information (PII) like names, phone numbers, and medical IDs are masked before being used for analysis.

5. Audit Logging & Monitoring
All data access and changes are logged. Logs are monitored to detect unusual or unauthorized activities.

6. Regular Compliance Audits
Systems are checked periodically to ensure they meet the basic standards of GDPR and HIPAA, such as data minimization and user consent tracking.


✅ Outcome:
By the end of this project, a simple yet effective data security framework was designed. While the project is theoretical, it reflects how real organizations must structure their data pipelines to ensure privacy, trust, and legal compliance.

This is a valuable skill in the big data and cloud era where data governance plays a major role in company reputation and legal safety.
